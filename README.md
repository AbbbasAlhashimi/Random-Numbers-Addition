# Random-Numbers-Addition
A game to test the summation of randomly displayed Integer Numbers
This small project is an application of Math.Random Method that generates random numbers with an answer<br>
If the sum of randomly initialized numbers is correct, the alert message will confirm that.<br>
IF the the iserted Sum value isn't correct, the alert message will confirm it's a wrong entry and displays the correct answer.<br>
I tried to clean the code so I divided the script into two files: one initialize values, and the other process them. I hope you find it helpful.
